Light Weight OpenGL
===

The Light Weight OpenGL library provides a convenience layer on top of the
OpenGLRaw library.

The purpose is to provide a less FFI looking programming interface, while
maintaining the similarities to the C API.

To give a 'batteries included' feeling, the Light Weight OpenGL library
integrates with the linear (vectors and matrices) library and the
JuicyPixels (image handling) library.
